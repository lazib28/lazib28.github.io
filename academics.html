              <p class="body2">My early years of schooling weren't eventful,in terms of academics,I mean I never did win any spelling bee or debate competitons.From a non-academic perspective, it was quite eventful but i won't get down to all of that since this is not a blog,rather a casual break-down of my academic career. I had the fortune/misfortune (ehh I am not sure) of studying throughout the same school over 15 years. That is the <a href="https://ihsbd.net/" >International Turkish Hope School </a>now rebranded as International Hope School Bangladesh.I was certainly not the brightest pupil in the class.Back then,my chief interests were English and Maths.The latter continues to fascinate me to this day whilst the former I fell out of my love quite soon after my IGCSE English Exam. My bane back in the day was Bengali Language and Literature,and for some reason the subject-teacher always singled me out for questions pertaining to whatever text we used to be studying back then.I guess she used to do it for my own good,but it certainly didn't feel like it back then. </p>

              <p class="body2">I sat for my <a href="https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/edexcel-international-gcses-and-edexcel-certificates.html">IGCSE </a>back in May of 2016. Obviously,prior to all of this,involved months of nervous yet religious revision.It all seemed a bit much at times, but in retrospect I did learn a great deal about time-management(and obviously all the subjects I took) and I met a lot of great teachers during that period. I ended up getting 7A* and 1B. The B I got was in English...sigh.I also ended up getting World Highest in Further Maths which was cool.
              I had H.Bio,Bio, Chem,Phy,English,Bangla,Maths-B and Further-Maths(wish I had taken Economics but ohh well I did go on to do a course in Uni)

              <p class="body2">In my <a href="https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/edexcel-international-advanced-levels.html">A'levels</a>,I took Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Maths.
              A'levels proved to be quite a tough cookie to crack,especially the A2 Units.I ended up getting  1A* AND 3A. The sole A* being from physics. Looking back, I probably should've studied harder in grade-12 but the anxiety caused by looming important life decisions got the better of me.Ohh it was during this time,I got selected to represent my school in the <a href="http://www.biochemolympiad.org/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi">Bio-Chemistry Olympiad</a>.We as a team had won the title two times from 2016-2017 whilst we finished as runners-up in the 2018 edition of the olmpiad.</p>

The contents of the courses are quite challenging but thankfully some of the faculties are really helpful.Also I did make a whole lot of cool friends and that always helps.</p>

              <p class="body2">During the pandemic, I started the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/">cs50 </a>course provided on <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edx</a> by <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a> as a way of remaining productive.Going into the course, I had no prior experience in anything related to coding.(Just like the 2/3rd of the people who had previously taken the course,as told by the cs50 website).Now that I am towards the end of the course, I have to say I have taken quite the interest in computer-science. Throughout the course I learned quite a bit of C,Python and sql along with a bit of java-script,html and CSS. Most importantly though, I learned how powerful computing tools can be in solving real-life problems.I am looking forward to the rest of my C.S journey.</p>
